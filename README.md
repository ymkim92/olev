  * advantage
    * simple 
      * empty bonnet
      * easy to repair it
  * disadvantage
    * recharging time is longer than filling oil

### Future of EV
* Oil is the best energy: easy to keeping and safe
* but, it will be out of stock

### How to recharge

options
* plugin charge
* battery swap: better place, battery swap of Tesla Motors
* wireless charge: olev
 

## What is OLEV?
<!--
From 2008
I'm not an electric engineer, but software engineer.
I don't know deep inside of electricity and devices about electricity.
I've just pick up this knowlegde from my previous work.

problems
* power efficiency:
  * how much energy can get from primary to secondary coil (now avg. 80%)
  * gap between pick up and surface of road (now, 20cm)
